# A Note on Testing

## Learning Goals

- Use tests to understand your algorithm and discover test cases

## When To Run Tests

If we have made a test suite available for a problem, please refrain from
looking at or running those tests until you have:

- Passed the tests given in the README
- Passed the tests you wrote yourself

This will give you a chance to think through the problem and write your own test
cases, which is a skill you'll need when interviewing.

In some interview settings, you won't have tests provided to confirm that your
algorithm meets the specifications. It's left to you and your conversation with
the interviewer to uncover potential edge cases that your algorithm may need to
cover, and to find ways to verify your work on your own.

After you run our tests, you might notice that you missed some test cases: this
is a good thing - it's a chance for you to learn and grow as a programmer. You
won't always think of all of the necessary test cases, but as time goes by,
you'll get better and better at thinking of all of the possible inputs that need
to be solved for before a solution can be considered complete.
